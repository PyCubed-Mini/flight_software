# BeepSat (pycubedmini version)

Currently we have 3 versions of software: basic, advanced, and state_machine.
Basic and advanced are drop in replacements for the upstream versions, while state_machine restructures the advanced flight software to work with a state_machine.

See the [state_machine README](state_machine/README.md) for more details on the state machine implementation.
