Each plugin is an independent set of tasks along with the driver libraries (`lib`), and pycubed driver (`pycubed.py`).

## Plugin Descriptions

* `example` is meant to be a minimum working example of the state machine functionality that can run on a personal computer
* `test` is meant to exercise all of the flight software features on a personal computer
* `advanced` is meant to provide the same functionality as the pycubed `software_example_beepsat/advanced` flight code and runs on the flight hardware
