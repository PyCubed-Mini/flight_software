Dependencies 
------------

The required packages for this project are:
   - `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
   - `ImageMagick <http://www.imagemagick.org/>`_
   - `graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_

Numpy is used for running the emulated sattelite and is therefore not required for building.
ImageMagick and graphviz are used to create a state machine diagram along with your built files.
